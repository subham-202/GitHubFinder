This Github Finder project is built using React, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It also uses Daisy UI, which is a React UI library that provides a set of pre-designed components for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

In addition, the project uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. The Context API is used for managing the application's state and data, allowing for easy sharing and management of information between components.

Finally, the project utilizes Reducers, which are pure functions in React that update the state of the application in response to specific actions.

The Github Finder project allows users to search for Github users by username and view their profiles, including information about their repositories and followers. The project provides a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy to navigate and find the information you need.
